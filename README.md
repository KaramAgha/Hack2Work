# RouteToWork

This prototype was completed as part of DWP's Hack2Work event in July 2021.
The tool is found within `/govuk-prototype-kit-9.14.0`. This project contains MongoDB infrastructure
leftover from a previous iteration, however this has not been cleaned up due to the time restrictions
of the Hackathon.

## Running the tool

1. Run `npm install` within the `govuk-prototype-kit-9.14.0` directory
2. Run `npm start`
